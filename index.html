            <div class="coffee_container"><h2 class=h2_coffee>Coffee</h2>
                <div class="coffee_block">Ever since I've been a little kid, I've enjoyed coffee quite a bit, but over the last few years, I've been acquiring a different kind of taste for coffee. The main change for me is that I've started enjoying a more bitter coffee like black coffee, and espressos with nothing to mellow out the flavor. This is what could be considered the beginnings of what made me begin the search for the best way to brew a good cup of coffee, depending on what it was. The ones that I will be mentioning are the ones that I've been working on and have attempted myself at least in some sense or have tasted somewhere somehow.</div>

            <div class="coffee_block"><h3 class=coffee_title>Coffee Beans</h3>
             <p class="coffee_content">This is my most recent discovery, but what I've found is that the "flavor profile" of the coffee bean, is heavily dependent upon the region that it's from, disregarding roasting methods. The variable that affects the flavor the most is probably the elevation. This is the reason why a coffee from a Latin region will taste so much more different than one that's from Africa. With a little bit of research I've also found that the reason behind this is due to the maturation process of the beans. Beans that are in higher elevations have a slow maturation process which comes from the result of less available water, which limits the size of the cherry, and also the harshness of the environment, where a harsh environment causes a slower growing cherry and therefore a more complex concoction of sugars. This may be the reason why people can pick up on "nutty" or "chocolate notes". Depending on the region, there may be different profiles that would differentiable from one another. This could become much more complex but I'd rather spare any further details, especially since I'm still quite lacking in knowledge in this area. (as well as in others but I'm trying)</p>
